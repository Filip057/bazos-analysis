# BAZOS ANALYSIS 

## Web scrapping app with API 

The goal of this app is to scrape car offers data, save them into a database, and expose them through an API. Users will be able to send GET requests with various filters to compare offers against the data. Future plans include adding more features to the app.

### Tech Stack 
- Python 3.10
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- BeautifulSoup
- Asyncio and Aiohttp

### Struggles and Assistance Needed
- **Direct Connection for Asynchronous Web Scraping:** Difficulty establishing a seamless connection between asynchronous web scraping and database integration.
- **Database Connection Error:** Encountering "sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such column: id" while attempting to connect with the database.
- **Web Scraping Optimization:** Recognizing the need for improvements in web scraping functionality to enhance efficiency and performance.

Any assistance, guidance, or suggestions on overcoming these challenges would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if you have insights or recommendations for enhancing other aspects of the project, I am open to feedback. Thank you for your support!
